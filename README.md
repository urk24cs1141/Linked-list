OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

Project Title:

File Handling Operations in C – Creation, Reading, Writing, and Appending to Text Files

Project Overview:

This project presents a simple yet comprehensive implementation of file handling concepts in the C programming language. File handling is a core component of system-level programming and is crucial for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to perform four essential operations on files—creating, writing, reading, and appending—through a structured C program.

In this program, we use a .txt file named text.txt to show how data can be stored permanently and modified over time. The project follows a step-by-step approach to first create a file and write initial content, then read and display this content, append new data to the file, and finally re-read the file to show the updated contents. It serves as a practical demonstration of the use of file input/output (I/O) operations in C, employing functions such as fopen(), fprintf(), fgetc(), and fclose().

Key Functionalities:

File Creation and Writing:
The program starts by creating a new file named text.txt using the "w" (write) mode. If the file already exists, this mode overwrites the existing content. If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created. The fprintf() function is used to write two lines of text to the file. This segment teaches how to handle file creation and how to write formatted output to a file in C.

2.File Reading:

Once the data is written, the file is reopened in "r" (read) mode. It is then read character-by-character using the fgetc() function, and the contents are displayed on the screen using putchar(). This section is vital for understanding how to retrieve data from a file and display it using standard output functions.

3.Appending Data:

After displaying the original content, the file is reopened in "a" (append) mode. This mode allows the program to add new data to the end of the file without deleting the existing content. A new line is appended using fprintf(). This operation demonstrates how existing files can be updated with new content while preserving previous data.

4.Re-reading Updated File Content:

To confirm that the append operation was successful, the program opens the file again in "r" mode and displays the full content including the newly added line. This final step verifies that all previous operations have been executed correctly.

Learning Objectives:

Understand different file modes in C: "r", "w", and "a".
Learn how to open and close files using fopen() and fclose().
Use fprintf() for writing formatted text and fgetc() for reading character-by-character.
Handle file I/O errors by checking if the file pointer is NULL.
Apply standard input/output functions to manage persistent data storage.
Conclusion:

This project provides a hands-on experience with file handling in C, demonstrating how to manage text files using various modes. It emphasizes the importance of error handling and step-by-step validation, which are critical in real-world systems where file operations may fail due to missing permissions, incorrect paths, or corrupted files.

By combining writing, reading, and appending operations in a single application, this program offers a holistic view of how files are used in everyday software and helps build a solid foundation for further exploration into file I/O in C and other programming languages.
